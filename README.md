PRISSMA Studio
===========
### A PRISSMA Prism Designer

PRISSMA Studio is a web application that assist [PRISSMA](http://wimmics.inria.fr/projects/prissma) designers in creating Prisms.

PRISSMA Studio supports designers in the creation of Fresnel Lenses and Formats, and eases the definition of the associated PRISSMA context.

Once created, Prisms can be stored on the file system of PRISSMA-equipped mobile devices, where they will be pro- cessed by the PRISSMA selection algorithm.
