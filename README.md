PRISSMA Studio
===========
### A Prism Designer for PRISSMA

PRISSMA Studio is a web application that assist [PRISSMA](http://wimmics.inria.fr/projects/prissma) designers in creating Prisms, according to the [PRISSMA vocabulary](ns.inria.fr/prissma/v2/prissma_v2.html).

PRISSMA Studio supports designers in the creation of [Fresnel](http://www.w3.org/2005/04/fresnel-info/manual/) Lenses and Formats, and eases the definition of the associated [PRISSMA context](http://ns.inria.fr/prissma/v2/prissma_v2.html#Context).

Once created, Prisms can be stored on the file system of PRISSMA-equipped mobile devices, where they will be processed by the [PRISSMA selection algorithm](http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/sites/default/files/papers/paper_81.pdf) .
